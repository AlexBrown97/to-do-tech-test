# TODO

Todo is a little app. It's based on create-react-app and material-ui.

## Setup

To run this project you must have Node.js and NPM installed.

To get started, run these commands:

```
npm ci
npm start
npm test
```

## The Task

You should see three failing tests, your job is the following:

1. Get those tests passing by implementing features described below
2. Improve any code you think could use some love
3. GIT commit each step
4. Stop after 40 minutes

Remember, we'd much rather see an incomplete response than nothing at all. Wherever you get to in the time limit, commit and push it.

Good luck!

## Feature One

Each task has a point value associated with it. This represents how important it is to us. The task list should always be shown with the most important tasks at the top of the list.

## Feature Two

We want to make it obvious at a glance which tasks are the really crucial ones. Any task that has a point value 10 or above should have a class 'critical' on it. Any other task should have the class 'normal'.

## Feature Three

Our users are keen to be able to add point values to tasks with a natural language style input. When a user inputs a task name they should be able to say, for example, 'do stuff 10pts' and have a task added of the form `{name: 'do stuff', points: 10}`.

## Design requests

Design has a few things they'd like to see changed before this goes out!

- Centre the card vertically on the page
- Make the TODO heading more prominant, bigger and bolder.
- Add a light grey to the background behind the card.
- Vertically centre align the Add button and text field.
